					On a Friday morning in November at the 96th street New York Public Library, the second floor is crowded with strollers at the doorway and the squeals of children. The children are participating in one of the library’s many popular programs, Toy Time.

					Since the pandemic, New York Libraries, which includes Brooklyn Public Library (BPL), New York Public Library (NYPL), and Queens Public Library (QPL), have seen major growth, with program and library attendance the highest it has been in the last five years.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Brooklyn Public Library is one of the most democratic institutions in the borough and increasingly an important third space,” said Fritzi Bodenheimer, press officer for the Brooklyn Public Library. “Everyone is welcome here. You can come and spend all day without ever having to buy something.”
			</p>
			

			<p>According to data reports from The Libraries, the New York Public Library’s attendance has more than doubled since 2021.

			<p> Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) and Queens Public Library (QPL) also saw growth of their own. BPL saw a 640% increase in attendance from 812K in 2021 to 6 million in 2025. 
				
			“You have access to all of the world’s knowledge through our collection of books and things,” said Bodenheimer. 
			</p>
		<!--I understand like 40% of this code but I saw the projects linked from previous classes where they used tweets and social media so I decided to challenge myself to do it too. It was easy. I googled how to add an IG post and it told me I could click on the 3 dots at the top of the post and copy and paste embedded code. --> 

			<p>
			Just this year alone BPL has held over 80K program sessions, including live performances, author talks, and art exhibitions. In July 2023, the central branch of BPL hosted ‘The Book of Hov’ exhibition, which focused on Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter’s music career and contributions.
			<br>
			<br>

			The NYPL also provides several free literacy programs such as early literacy for ages 0-5, which offers storytimes and other resources to help children read and learn. For adults, NYPL has free English classes and tutoring, according to the NYPL. 
			<br>

			<br>
			This programming also includes the NYPL After School, an after school program for children ages 6-12, Monday to Thursday, where children can get help with homework from tutors, reading recommendations, and more activities, according to the NYPL.
			<br>
			<br>
			The increase in library attendance comes at a time where New York City Public Schools (NYCPS) students are winning in literacy too, as grades 3-8 show increased proficiency in ELA, according to 2025 NYCPS Math and ELA state test results. 

			<br> 
			<br> 
			“Yeah, I do think it's increasing,” said Genesis Medina, a 6th grade teacher at Uncommon Williamsburg Middle School. “You know when there's a summer break it's a little bit stagnant, but as the year goes on, it does get better.”
			</p>
			<p>
			NYC Public Schools also implemented NYC Reads in the school year 2024-25, an initiative that aims to make students better readers through researched, phonics-based reading curricula, according to NYC Reads.

			<br>
			“To me, this is a clear sign that we are on the right track,” said Melissa Aviles-Ramos, NYC public school chancellor, in an Aug. 2025 Youtube video.

			The wins in literacy for New York City comes at a time where America is still facing challenges with boosting literacy rates in students. According to The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as the Nation’s Report Card, the average reading score for both fourth and eighth grade students was two points lower compared to 2022. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The scores prompted a response from the Department of Education in 2025. “Today’s NAEP results reveal a heartbreaking reality for American students and confirm our worst fears,” said the Department of Education in a Jan. 29 press release. “Not only did most students not recover from pandemic-related learning loss, but those students who were the most behind and needed the most support have fallen even further behind.”
